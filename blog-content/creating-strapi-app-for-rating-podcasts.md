After over a decade of listening to a handful of podcasts, I've begun to wonder which episodes I've enjoyed the most.  I decided to start tracking it using Strapi CMS and building a UI to display my ratings.  As of right now I've got a simple graph showing each episode's rankings and a set of cards ordered by rank.

I've rated a few episodes of the Monstercat podcast and the NYT podcast Down The Rabbit Hole.  I plan to rank all episodes of these 2 podcasts before adding any other ones to the list.  Monstercat's 300+ episodes are going to take me a while, so hopefully I'll have some fun design ideas by then.

AU REVOIR!
